						Trans-Continental Dance Collaborative is a dance film project directed
						by Mira Cook and Robin Cantrell, utilizing dance artists worldwide. 
						Slated to embark in 2008, the TCDC directors will be visiting dance
						companies throughout Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America in order
						to create site specific choreographic mini works with local artists.
						These segments will be recorded and combined into one cohesive dance
						film that transitions through various locations and performers.
						Additionally, TCDC will be holding dance film screenings in under-served 
						communities along their travel route. Upon their return to the
						US, multi-media performances will be held in New York and San Francisco
						incorporating live dancers, excerpts from the dance film and artifacts
						from the trip.
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: left">
						TCDC expands cultural understanding through the art of dance. This is
						achieved by sharing information with communities abroad and in turn
						bringing home unique images of artists that would not be viewed otherwise.
						TCDC promotes communication across cultural and language barriers, using
						the common language of dance. The results are tangible: a lasting
						accessible documentation of the journey, and the creation of a global
						network of dance artists. It is through this broadening of cultural
						awareness that Trans-Continental Dance Collaborative promotes
						world peace.
