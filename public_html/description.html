								Project Description
							</b>
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: left">
							Trans-Continental Dance Collaborative is a dance film 
							project focused on the creation of collaborative dance 
							films set in the US and foreign locations.  Founded in 
							2006 by Robin Cantrell and Mira Cook, TCDC serves as a 
							way to share creative spontaneous moments of dance, 
							through the more accessible medium of film.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: left">
							Currently manifested as a series of short films, TCDC 
							plans to make a full length film, shot in locations 
							around the world.  This will take place over the course 
							of a longer period of travel with the cooperation of 
							associated dance artists, companies and those met along 
							the way. In collaboration with the Dance Films 
							Association, TCDC will hold dance film screenings as 
							they stop in locations along their travel route.

								Purpose
							</b>
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: left">
							TCDC expands cultural understanding through the art of 
							dance. This is achieved by sharing information with 
							communities abroad and in turn bringing home unique 
							images of artists that would not be viewed otherwise. 
							TCDC promotes communication across cultural and language 
							barriers, using the common language of dance. The results 
							are tangible: a lasting accessible documentation of the 
							journey, and the creation of a global network of dance 
							artists. It is through this broadening of cultural 
							awareness that Trans-Continental Dance Collaborative 
							promotes world peace.
